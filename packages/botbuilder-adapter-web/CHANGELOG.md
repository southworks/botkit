# botbuilder-adapter-web changelog

# 1.0.2

* Add [isConnected()](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/reference/web.html#isconnected) method to WebAdapter. This allows a bot to check the status of a (potentially stale) websocket connection before sending messages. Thanks to [@Naktibalda](https://github.com/Naktibalda) for [this contribution](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1644).
